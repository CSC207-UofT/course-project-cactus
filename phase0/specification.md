## Specification

The program is a grocery list management Android app. When the app is run, the user will be prompted to log in or create an account. After logging in, the user should be able to create and delete grocery lists, which are divided into user-specified categories (i.e store, food group), and add and delete items in each grocery list through an interactive interface.
The user should also be able to create a default weekly list which automatically creates a new list with user-specified items and categories.

The app has recommendation features as well:  
1. Recommends items by tracking the user’s added items
2. Recommends items by tracking all users’ added items
3. Recommends items to be added to the default weekly list if the app notices recurring items

All user information will be stored on a server, which will provide the following features:  
1. Authenticate users
2. Retrieve and save grocery lists
3. Share grocery lists with other users
4. Find other users to add as friends to easily share lists
